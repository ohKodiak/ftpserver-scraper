# ftpserver-scraper
uses selenium and a stack implentation of the depth first search algorithm to scrape ftp servers for netCDF files.

Chose an iterative approach rather than a recursive approach because Selenium was not executing the recursive functions. 
This code can be used with command line url arguments and login credentials.
