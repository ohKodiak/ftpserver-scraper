# ftpserver-scraper
uses selenium and a stack implentation of the depth first search algorithm to scrape ftp servers for netCDF files.

Chose an iterative approach rather than a recursive approach because Selenium was not executing the recursive functions. 
This code can be used with command line url arguments and login credentials. 




scrape2.py was first working version, customdownload.py allows for specified download path
